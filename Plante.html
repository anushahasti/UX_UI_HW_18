          <h2 class="sectionHeading">The Challenge</h2>
          <p >​
            Our team is passionate about growing plants, and loving greenery naturally, so we Instantly connected to a point on taking care of plants and various difficulties in finding appropriate plants according to climate and lifestyle. These discussions on plants made us question ourselves on how can we provide a solution for plant owners and also encourage and attract newbies towards growing plants using our Platae mobile app
            </p>
    
   

        <h2 class="sectionHeading">The Approach</h2>
          <p >​
            We started getting into user thoughts through interviews and surveys. After gathering and collecting all the pain points, we started to imagine users through our Proto-persona. This helped us brainstorm and figure out the features that users would wish to see in Plantae. Further, we were able to successfully design and prototype features with some iterations through user testings and feedback.

            Our goal was to give plant owners and enthusiasts, a more personable, interactive, and innovative experience through our PLANTAE app

We assume they are our participants and through them, we will dive into learning about the challenges that plant owners face. We want to understand how they feel about their current plant care routine and what would help them take better care of their plant buddies.

<h2>Affinity Diagram
</h2>
<p>We gathered all of our data from 6 persons into an affinity diagram to answer the question: "what are the most common points we see here?". From the data collected, we were able to narrow down our data to into few groups such as plant preferences, care, deterrents and existing knowledge.

<h2>User Persona
</h2>
<p>We were overwhelmed with the survey responses and the amount of detail our users provided in our interviews. We were able to create a frame work for our user persona. Juhi here represents the anticipated overall Plantae users.  
</p>
<div class="imageContainer col-lg-12 col-md-8 col-sm-12">

</div>

<p>juhi - we see our user persona as someone who is established or beginning to be, and looking to start focusing her energy in adding greenery to her space, but needed guidance to do this successfully. 

  Throughout the rest of the design process we made sure to reference Juhi as a reminder of who we were designing for  through furthuer design process , flows of testing and iterations.

<h2>Problem Statement
</h2>
<p>Users who are ready to add new responsibilities to their routine or developing an interest in plants. But they find it difficult to maintain the plant health, determine the appropriate plants for their lifestyles and easily access botanical care resources.

<h2>Ideate
</h2>

<h2>Brainstorming
</h2>
<p>Using our data from research, we began brainstorming via the "I like, I wish, what if" method 

  To determine what possible features we could include in our app.

<h2>Feature Prioritization Matrix

<h2>Story Board

<h2>Competitor Analysis
</h2>

<p>
  Something that was quite surprising to us was the number of apps that existed with similar concepts to ours. So we realized our biggest threat was COMPETITION and we wanted to make sure our app was unique and provided additional value to the user. We considered Vera, Planta and Plant lens as three direct competitors to our app

    <h3>Strengths in other apps 

    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scanner for identification and diagnosis.

      <li>
        Easy to maneuver through applications (user flow)

      <li>
        Home pages are not developed, no call to action

    </h3>
    <ul>
  
        <li>
          ​Planta app has everything a plant owner needs, Plant Lens offers unique features, and Vera appeals to a specific audience based on aesthetic​

  <div class="imageContainer col-12">
    <h3>Opportunities to improve
    </h3>
    <ul>
  
        <li>
          Some functions could be organized differently. (hierarchy)

  
        </li>
        <li>
          Can develop more on home or landing pages since many are missing call to actions

<h2>User Flow</h2>
<p>
  How would users navigate through Plantae?  This question made us create a user flow, to organize the actions in a more user friendly manner.

<h2>Wireframing & Prototype

</h2>
<p>
  Here are some of the wireframes that we created. We drew some sketches inspired from the user flow that we defined and then converted into these low-fidelity wireframes.
</p>

<h3>Testing

</h3>
<p>
  Usability test for low-fidelity prototype


</p>

<p>
  After creating our wireframes and first iteration of a user flow, we went straight into testing of our main features of the app. It was important for us to iron out any issues prior to building our high-fidelity prototypes. We wanted to  ensure our designs were easy to understand, with familiar flows and concepts.

</p>

<p>
  Objective : To confirm if users can successfully complete the  given task.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Task 1: Create Account


    </p>
    <p>
      Success Criteria: User reaches the Home Page screen


    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Task 2: Add a plant to your plant profile


    </p>
    <p>
      Success Criteria: Users adds Plant to their profile


    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Task 3: Setting Watering Schedule

    </p>
    <p>
      Success Criteria: Users adds Plant to their profile


    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Post-User Testing Recommendations

  <img src="css/images/Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 9.39.08 PM.png">
</div>
<p>Getting early feedback before designing the entire experience was important. Feedback collected from users is taken and applied in mid-Fidelity and High-Fidelity wireframes.

</p>

<h3>
  UI and color scheme


</h3>
<p>The UI is kept clean and sleek to allude to the transparency between the app developer and user.  The warm green color is used to have the connection and evoke encouraging environment.

</p>

<h3>High Fidelity Prototype

</h3>

<div class="emailContain">
  
</div>

<h3>High Fidelity Prototype

</h3>
<p>
Also to have visual design and to maintain consistency these UI elements are applied to Plantae in High Fidelity wireframes 

Plantae aims to guide both curious plant owners and users who are ready to add new responsibilities of plant care. It provides resources to all expertise levels of plant owners.

<h3>Retrospective

</h3>
<p>Challenges</p>

<p>
  Further user tests are made with High- fidelity prototypes, The prototype was well-received by my limited test group. Due to social distancing measures, I was not able to interview and test it out with as many users as I would have like. The feedback I gotten was that this app would be definitely their need and they would use on daily basis for water reminders and plant care


</p>
<p>
  What can be improved 
</p>

<p>
  I personally felt app can have more interaction design elements to make it much more interesting for user and I couldn't spend much time on app logo, In future I would work on app logo to make it better.  
</p>
<p>
  Reflection</p>

  <p>I am thankful for my team as this is my first team work, I could expand my knowledge at various aspects, I learnt much more detailed version of using figma tool also For my next project, I hope to increase the scale and tackle more pertinent issues.

  </p>
